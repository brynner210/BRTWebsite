    Tower vertical expansion at University Hospital. Housed on the top two

    square feet of space devoted to patient and family friendly amenities.<br><br>
    <img id="hospital" alt="hospital_img" src="images/hospital.jpg"/><br>
    The dedicated "Tree House" entrance welcomes patients and visitors with
    an atmosphere made just for kids. The new facility operates as a
    hospital-within-a-hospital and enhances the pediatric education and
    research missions that are integral to University Hospital, as well as
    continues to serve as a vocal advocate for regional children's health
    issues. <br><br>
    The Golisano Children's Hospital is dedicated to meeting the needs of
    children and their families and is committed to providing the best possible
    care for all we serve. <br><br>
    Since 2015, Big Red Thon has raised $40,000 our first year, $21,000 our
    second year, and $21,000 so far this year!
